Your task is to add early stopping to the loop (based on validation accuracy). Early stopping usually means exiting the training loop if the validation accuracy hasn't improved for `patience` number of steps. Don't forget to save the best model parameters according to validation accuracy. You will need `copy.deepcopy` and the `state_dict` for this."
