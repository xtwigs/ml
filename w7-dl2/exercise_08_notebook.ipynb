    "Next we implement a method for fitting (training) our model. For many models early stopping can save a lot of training time. Your task is to add early stopping to the loop (based on validation accuracy). Early stopping usually means exiting the training loop if the validation accuracy hasn't improved for `patience` number of steps. Don't forget to save the best model parameters according to validation accuracy. You will need `copy.deepcopy` and the `state_dict` for this."
